## About
The Simple Textures GUI Texturepack brings a minimalist, uncluttered look to Minecraft's user interfaces. Menus, inventories and GUI elements have been redesigned to provide a clearer, more modern look - perfect for players who want to avoid unnecessary visual distractions and focus on the essentials. However, this is currently only the GUI version as we have only edited a maximum of 10% of all minecraft textures. This pack is also not yet fully permanent, but will receive regular updates with new textures. A release for the full version with all Minecraft textures is not yet fixed.

### Note: 
This is an alpha version, we have currently only worked on the hotbar and hearts. More textures will follow in the near future. - Feedback is welcome!

### Important:
